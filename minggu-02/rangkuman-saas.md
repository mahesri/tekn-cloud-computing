# SaaS Summary

### 1. What's the different between IaaS, SaaS and PaaS

1. IaaS 

IaaS Stands for "Infrastrusture as a Service." This refers to the delivery of computing resources, such as servers and storage, over the internet. IaaS make those resources available to all customers on-demand, allowing them to scale and adjust their usage as needed.

2. SaaS

SaaS or "Software as a Service." Is refers to the delivery of software applications over the internet typically on subcription basis. Saas provide application that customers can accsess and use the software platform from anywhere, without needing to install it on their devices.

3. PaaS

PaaS is "platform as A service." this refers to the delivery of a platform for developing, runing, and managing applications over the internet.

### Conclusion
1. Iaas provide the infrastructure.
2. SaaS provides the software,
3. PaaS provides the platform for building, deploying dan managing applications


### 2. Saas Platform Achitecture

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model that provides software on a subscription basis and hosts it centrally, allowing users to access it through web browsers. SaaS is commonly used for various business applications, including office, messaging, management software, and virtualization, and is a part of cloud computing, alongside Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Desktop as a Service (DaaS).

SaaS is associated with Application Service Providers (ASPs) who offer web-based applications to business users. Unlike early internet-delivered software, modern SaaS applications are built on a single-instance, multi-tenant architecture, offering feature-rich experiences comparable to on-premise applications. Aggregators bundle SaaS offerings from different vendors into unified application platforms.

The SaaS provider hosts the application centrally, deploying patches and upgrades transparently over the internet. Many SaaS vendors provide APIs for developers to create composite applications, and they implement various security mechanisms to ensure data security during transmission and storage.

SaaS architecture typically involves a single application version and configuration for all customers, with scalability achieved through horizontal scaling. While some exceptions exist, most SaaS solutions employ multitenancy to manage a large customer base cost-effectively.

There are two main types of SaaS: Vertical SaaS, tailored to specific industries, and Horizontal SaaS, which focuses on software categories applicable to various industries.

Benefits of SaaS include reduced deployment costs, minimized IT infrastructure requirements, ease of integration, and shorter time-to-value intervals. It allows organizations of all sizes to shift from reactive IT cost centers to proactive, value-producing entities.

Transitioning to SaaS requires assessing its impact on existing IT assets, addressing data security standards, and evaluating reporting services. SaaS can change IT roles and responsibilities, potentially causing a shift from gatekeeper to a more collaborative role.

### conclusion

Enterprises should consider the flexibility and risk-management implications of adding SaaS to their IT services portfolio. Successful integration and composition are critical for incorporating SaaS effectively into a service-centric IT infrastructure, and it is believed that the future of enterprise computing will include a combination of on-premise and cloud-based solutions.
